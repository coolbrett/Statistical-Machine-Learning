# Statistical-Machine-Learning
Coursework from Dr. Andrew Penland's Statistical Machine Learning course at Western Carolina University

This is just coursework that we do on a weekly basis. Most of us are just learning Machine Learning concepts for the first time.
More impressive work will probably be in the later weeks than the earlier weeks. 

Projects for this course will be in different repositories as I want those to be more visible with less searching involved
